# copier-template-pre-commit-mirrors

This is a template for our pre-commit mirrors.

> [!WARNING]  
> This template expects `sed` in your $PATH to be GNU sed. If you are on macOS, you can ensure this by running inside a conda environment with `sed` installed.

To create a new mirror, you can run the following command

```bash
pixi run generate /path/to/mirror
```
